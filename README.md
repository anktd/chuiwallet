# Chui Wallet - Run with ease 
*Chui means leopard in Swahili*

Chui Wallet was born from the need to provide **a simpler, business-friendly solution** for handling cryptocurrency payments. We noticed that many existing wallets were overly technical, leaving merchants overwhelmed with complex setups and prone to frustrating issues like missing transactions.

Inspired by the leopard—**fast, precise, and calm**—we build Chui to offer the same qualities: **speed, accuracy, and ease of use**. With this vision, Chui aims to **simplify crypto transactions for online businesses** and **eliminate common pain points** so merchants can focus on growing their operations, not troubleshooting their wallets.
